# cucumber-puppeteer-example

Write UI tests using Gherkin, Cucumber, and Puppeteer. This project is an example project on how to use [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). It uses the [React TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) project as a test UI.

Run `yarn` to get the dependencies and then run `yarn test` to execute the UI tests.
